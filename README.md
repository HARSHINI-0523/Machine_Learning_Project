# Thyroid Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** to detect thyroid diseases (such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism) based on patient data. By analyzing key medical parameters, the model classifies whether a patient is likely to have thyroid dysfunction or not — aiding early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 📌 Features

- 🤖 Built using **supervised machine learning models**
- 📋 Accepts **tabular medical data** as input
- 🩺 Predicts presence or absence of thyroid disorders
- 🔍 Includes **data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering**, and model selection
- 📊 Visual analytics with correlation heatmaps and histograms
- 💯 Compares multiple classifiers with accuracy & performance metrics

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy` – Data handling  
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – Visualization  
  - `Scikit-learn` – Machine Learning models and metrics

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses a publicly available **Thyroid Disease dataset**, which contains patient diagnostic attributes like:

- Age, Sex  
- TSH, T3, TT4, T4U, FTI hormone levels  
- Target class indicating thyroid status (e.g., negative, hyperthyroid, hypothyroid)

📥 **Download Dataset**: [https://l1nk.dev/td-dataset](https://l1nk.dev/td-dataset)

Preprocessing includes:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical values
- Dropping redundant or highly correlated features

## 🚀 How It Works

### 🔹 Step 1: Data Loading & Cleaning

- Load dataset using Pandas
- Check for null values and outliers
- Drop unneeded columns or rows with excessive missing values
- Encode categorical columns (like gender)

### 🔹 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize class distribution  
- Generate **correlation heatmap** to understand feature importance  
- Plot histograms for numeric columns

### 🔹 Step 3: Feature Selection & Preprocessing

- Use correlation and domain knowledge to select key features
- Scale features using `StandardScaler`
- Split data into **training** and **testing** sets (typically 80/20)

### 🔹 Step 4: Model Training

Multiple models are trained and compared:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Example:
rf = RandomForestClassifier()
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 🔹 Step 5: Evaluation
Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

Display confusion matrix and classification report

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

y_pred = rf.predict(X_test)
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### 📊 Results
✅ Achieved X% accuracy using Random Forest (replace X with actual result)

🧾 Detailed classification report with precision, recall, and F1 score

📉 Confusion matrix shows model’s diagnostic capability

🧠 Model performs well in distinguishing between thyroid conditions and healthy cases

### 📌 Future Improvements
🔬 Incorporate clinical expert feedback on features

🧠 Explore deep learning models or ensemble boosting techniques

📱 Build a web-based app for doctors using Streamlit or Flask

📈 Use larger datasets with more real-world patient samples
